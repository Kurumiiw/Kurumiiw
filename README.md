Hello! I'm **Kurumii**! Nice to meet you! 

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) persuing a degree in [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20universities%20in%20continental%20Europe%20usually%20translate%20%22informatics%22%20as%20computer%20science%2C%20or%20sometimes%20information%20and%20computer%20science%2C%20although%20technical%20universities%20may%20translate%20it%20as%20computer%20science%20%26%20engineering.) (computer science).

*Comfy sips of coffee~*

Usually, I'm doing something related to:
- Web-development / frontend-applications
- Low-level / embedded systems
- Japanese and language (and anime)
- Physics simulation and graphical software
- Games and music (usually, combined! 🥁)
