Hello! I'm **Ola**! Nice to meet you!

👉 I am a software developer and IT-consultant currently working for [Bekk](https://www.bekk.no/), a Norway-based consultancy firm focusing on technology, design and management consulting. I have M.Sc. in [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20universities%20in%20continental%20Europe%20usually%20translate%20%22informatics%22%20as%20computer%20science%2C%20or%20sometimes%20information%20and%20computer%20science%2C%20although%20technical%20universities%20may%20translate%20it%20as%20computer%20science%20%26%20engineering.) from [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) with a focus on interaction design, learning and game technology. My thesis project was game design as a tool to increase physical activity, and involved the ideation and development of a new mobile game from scratch. The repo is pinned below. 

I also have a B.Sc. in informatics from NTNU. The thesis was done in collaboration with the [Norwegian Defence Research Establishment](https://www.ffi.no/en), on the topic of reliable communication protocols for use in constrained military networks. This work is also pinned below.

🧑‍🎓 During my time as a student, I have been involved in various technology-focused projects. From designing a computer processor from scratch based on the [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) at [Hackerspace NTNU](https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/) as an educational tool to explain computer technology, all the way to writing embedded system software code for satellites at [Orbit NTNU](https://orbitntnu.com/). I also spent half a year at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) as an exchange student. I would love to go back some day!

Some of my interests are:
- 💻 Full-stack development (Mostly React or Next.js + TypeScript for frontends and Spring + Kotlin for backends)
- 👨‍🔬 High-performance, low-level programming in C and C++
- 🚀 Simulation and computer graphics
- 🎮 Game development & serious games with popular engines like Unity and Godot
