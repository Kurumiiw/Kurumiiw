Hello! I'm **Ola**! Nice to meet you!

👉 I have a B.Sc. in [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20universities%20in%20continental%20Europe%20usually%20translate%20%22informatics%22%20as%20computer%20science%2C%20or%20sometimes%20information%20and%20computer%20science%2C%20although%20technical%20universities%20may%20translate%20it%20as%20computer%20science%20%26%20engineering.) (computer science), and currently I am a student at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) persuing a M.Sc. in informatics, specializing in game technology. I'm writing a thesis about a mobile game I am developing together with a co-author, which aims to get the player to be more active and go outside.

My bachelor's thesis was done in collaboration with the [Norwegian Defence Research Establishment](https://www.ffi.no/en), on the topic of reliable communication protocols for use in constrained military networks. The code and report can be found [here](https://github.com/Kurumiiw/Middleware/). 

🧑‍🎓 During my time as a student, I have been involved in various technology-focused projects. From designing a computer processor from scratch based on the [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) at [Hackerspace NTNU](https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/) as an educational tool to explain computer technology, all the way to writing embedded system software code for satellites at [Orbit NTNU](https://orbitntnu.com/). I also spent half a year at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) as an exchange student. I would love to go back some day!

I have previously worked as an intern at [Bekk](https://www.bekk.no/), a company focusing on IT, design, and business management consulting. I worked as a full-stack developer on one of their internal projects. Moreover, during the summer of 2022 I had an internship at [The Norwegian Tax Administration](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/) as a front-end developer for their summer AI project.

----

Some of my interests are:
- 💻 Full-stack development (Mostly React or Next.js + TypeScript for frontends and Spring + Kotlin for backends)
- 👨‍🔬 High-performance, low-level programming in C and C++
- 🚀 Simulation and computer graphics
- 🎮 Game development & serious games mostly with well-established engines like Unity and Godot
