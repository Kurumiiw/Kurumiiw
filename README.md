Hello! I'm **Ola**! Nice to meet you!

👉 Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) persuing a degree in [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20universities%20in%20continental%20Europe%20usually%20translate%20%22informatics%22%20as%20computer%20science%2C%20or%20sometimes%20information%20and%20computer%20science%2C%20although%20technical%20universities%20may%20translate%20it%20as%20computer%20science%20%26%20engineering.) (computer science). But first and foremost, I'm a self-proclaimed *massive* nerd.

🧑‍🎓 During my time as a student, I've been involved in various technology-focused projects. From designing an education-focused computer processor from scratch based on the [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) at [Hackerspace NTNU](https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/), all the way to writing embedded system software code for satellites at [Orbit NTNU](https://orbitntnu.com/).

I've previously worked as an intern at [The Norwegian Tax Administration](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/) as a front-end developer for their AI summer student project 2022.
